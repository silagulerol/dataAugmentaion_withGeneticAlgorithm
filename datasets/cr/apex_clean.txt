1	sd we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd 
1	design it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot weve ever tested 
1	image processing system a digic ii powered image processing system enables the sd to snap a limitless stream of megapixel photos at a respectable clip its start up time is tops in its class and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition 
1	image the sd rivals the canon g in image quality 
0	pricey i thought given all the reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey 
0	lcd i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen 
0	lcd when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen cracked and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen black and blue and purple blotches and streaks useless 
1	camera this camera is truely superb 
1	pictures the startup time quality of pictures and videos is outstanding 
0	manual control some more manual control would have been nice 
1	pictures they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact 
1	canon i went out and got the canon today 
1	picture ive taken about hundred shot with the canon in varying lighting situations all in auto mode and not one blurry picture

1	pictures sharper pictures 
1	size the canon is very small definitely pocket size but still easy to hold firmly 
1	powers up it powers up quickly so you wont miss that quick shot 
0	flash the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered 
1	image good image quality 
1	pics user interface battery charger all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd are both rich and color and high in detail the user interface is awesome the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time 
0	lcd after reading reviews of lcd problems cracked black blobs etc i figured that it was probably a very limited problem 
0	lcd after pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings 
1	weight camera is a paper weight 
1	sd i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot images so far with it

1	powerup powerup is quick and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on 
1	x mode quality i have especially enjoyed the x mode while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe 
0	camera shake you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with 
1	audio audio is mono and fairly acceptable quiet also with little distortions 
1	battery the battery life is not that of the casios but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got 
0	autofocus the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can 
0	compact i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature 
0	manual controls also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls

1	zoom great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one the megapixel one 
1	clips i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips i give it stars oh and btw while you take video clips you can zoom it too but still 
1	merge pictures photo stitch 
1	camera turn the camera on while pressing the button and itl show you the time and date 
0	battery battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times the camera battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but its normal 
0	sound the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera 
1	camera pictures i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures 
1	features if youll only read the whole manual youll find out even more cool features and youll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading 
1	camera its such a great camera i think it really was worth the investment 
1	designed if you havent noticed they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer 
1	made they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you dont like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer 
1	camera i bought this camera two days ago and im very pleased to say that it has been worth the money 
0	low light conditions only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash

1	photo the photo quality is amazing 
1	feels looks its fast feels great in your hand and looks great too 
1	prints ive printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views 
1	image as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen 
1	colors video another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty price tag and get a quality camera

1	build macros results video quality flash white balance overall build quality good macros results impressive video quality good pictures with flash excellent auto white balance 
1	camera could be better to be a perfect camera purple fringing details in high light area noise over iso red eyes processing artefacts loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light automatic autofocus whizing while video playback better video comression more manual controls longer lasting battery indicator for battery better protection of the lcd less weight

1	small durable it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket and i dont have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable 
1	covering there is also a small covering for the lens so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched 
1	picture small the picture quality surprised me when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good but i was wrong 
1	picture the picture quality of this camera is outstanding 
0	battery first off the battery 
0	battery this camera uses a lithium battery i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient because what if you are on vacation where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there 
0	battery not only is it inconvenient but also the battery life span is short 
0	batteries this isnt uncommon in cameras though just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries you should be fine 
0	zoom another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function 
0	zooms such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in wrong

0	macro the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function 
0	auto focus the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject

1	focus the focus is great though if you are not taking a macro shot 
0	cameras its not my first choice in cameras 
1	size i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size 
1	camera if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times then this is a great camera choice 
1	s after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace i decided on the s 
1	camera it has given me zero problems and the more i use it the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths 
0	small it is perhaps too small 
0	buttons read i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on 
0	size its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge 
0	delay shots the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots 
0	autofocus this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system 
0	resolution setting the lack of an intermediate resolution setting as other reviewers have suggested is a problem but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card 
0	hot the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away 
0	hot it is hot enough to be annoying 
1	small pictures this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo quality printer

1	snapshots its overkill for simple snapshots unless youve got way too much money to blow

0	design i then realized a major design flaw 
0	functionality all the cameras functionality is only available when the screen is functional

0	price the price is more 
0	software i originally gave this camera stars when i had windows it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is sooo not compatible with xp 
0	drivers the new drivers on cannons site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software 
0	software the adobe software also was wonderful in but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application 
1	pictures but it takes gorgeous pictures for a mp camera 
1	camera i love this camera 
0	memory the only thing i dont like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card first thing

1	camera i would recommend this camera unequivocally 
1	battery but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver 
1	camera a great camera but here are some points which i dont notice in most of the reviews here which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer 
1	elph s i purchased the elph s mainly because i thought it was cool 
1	exposure prints the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great 
1	smaller resolution but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution i had to have the s 
1	s this is my second digital camera but im much more impressed with the canon s digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc 
1	light tiny this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me which is great considering im an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting 
1	software the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive 
1	software the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any degree panorama shots 
0	on camera controls my only complaint and the reason i gave it stars instead of is that the on camera controls arent as intuitive as they should be 
0	work ive often struggled to get something to work the way i want it and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time 
1	camera other than that i love this camera 
1	pictures color rendering the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect 
1	size metal case use picture quality software the good small size durable seeming metal case easy to use visually distinctive good picture quality fast usb connection mostly intuitive operation really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas 
1	size s if compact size is your highest priority in a megapixel camera the canon powershot s digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design 
1	image quality weighs the s s image quality rates in the middle of its class but it can still be a reasonable choice for students families or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack 
1	camera i purchased this camera before it went on sale and while i wouldnt have minded keeping the extra it was definitely worth it 
1	product i have been absolutely completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities

0	pictures all that said i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera 
1	sharp color balance focus they are razor sharp the color balance is perfect and the focus is great 
0	pictures of people when taking pictures of people however it shows every flaw in the subjects skin 
0	pics other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better 
0	processing i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture 
1	camera i must say i think this is the coolest camera ive ever owned 
1	size first it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes maybe a scooch deeper 
1	use second it is incredibly easy to use 
1	photos i just went on a quick photo shoot in nycs central park today and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took if i do say so myself 
1	use the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot and with instant review on the lcd screen you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot 
1	optical zoom cap the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly and lo and behold a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off 
1	software i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc 
1	s at any rate if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back consider the canon s digital elph 
1	camera it really is the perfect travel camera plus it offers the convenience of digital photography 
0	why did i wait so long detail color rendition if youre looking for a digital camera to replace your big nikon or canon slr forget it film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical

1	memory expansion macro mode housing i wanted standard memory expansion macro mode and if possible a waterproof housing 
1	small even with the waterproof housing it is small 
1	lens the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you dont need to fuss with a lens cap 
1	housing the metal housing seems very rugged 
0	automatic modes id give it stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes 
0	auto mode for example in auto mode you cant use the flash redeye reduction you must be in manual mode for that 
0	auto color balance the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds 
0	dynamic range the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc 
1	macro mode the macro mode works well although it takes some practice since the camera doesnt clearly indicate when it cant focus 
1	lcd the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp even in sunlight and relatively easy on the battery 
1	panorama modes the panorama modes are wonderful 
1	small light its so small and light even with a spare battery you really can take it anywhere 
1	auto mode in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera

1	ease of use picture detail i was looking for something that wasnt too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detial 
1	size casing this camera is great wonderfully small and has attactive hi tech casing 
1	ease of use very easy to use for someone like me whos just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon 
1	controls ease of use the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use 
1	zoom the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective x zoom 
1	capacity this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory for example 
1	size so why the small digital elph rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality size because unless its small i wont cary it around 
1	size pictures after getting one for christmas from amazon im now a believer the digital elph is truly the worlds smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures 
1	pictures ive had this camera just over years and it takes pretty good pictures 
1	size the size is tiny which i love

1	size you willdefinitly appreciate the small size 
1	works works great no odor and uses regular bags 
1	diaper champ so far weve had no problems with the diaper champ at all 
1	diapers it contains the smell from our babys diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside 
1	odors refills i dont know if well run into trouble down the road with odors but so far i have no complaints and im very happy not to have to buy those refills 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ is the best we found 
1	bags there are no specail bags to deal with or buy 
1	bag we use the cheap gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around 
0	smelling now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will 
1	diaper we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it 
1	product it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and its fairly inexpensive as baby products go 
1	refills i love that you dont have to purchase expensive refills 
0	diaper wipes the cons at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth 
0	diaper champ in addition i dont believe that it is odorless 
0	odor my daughter is only months old and we do notice an odor 
1	diaper genie if i had to do it over again even with the cost savings of using any type of bag i would go w the diaper genie 
1	diaper champ its far better than all others on the market 
1	convenient refills its easier and much more convenient to use because it doesnt have clumsy and confusing refills 
1	use there is no odor and extremely easy to use 
1	garbage bags it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills

1	container the container is hard to open which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler and you do have to flip the handle carefully i dont consider these difficulties but features for the older baby 
0	size even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast 
0	size odor it seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless 
1	product this is a must have product for all new moms 
0	diaper genie the diaper genie needs its own refill bags in order to work and thats just more money that you dont have to spend 
1	work this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers 
0	item i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and cant tightly bundle it without a mess the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail 
0	fit my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesnt even fit a smaller sized garbage bag 
0	hole the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers and theyre on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un soiled they are 
1	fill unload it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie plus why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store 
1	diaper it also holds a lot more diapers 
1	size look at the size of it 
0	odor i have noticed an odor when unloading the diaper champ but at least you dont smell anything every time you use it 
1	diaper i highly recommend this 
0	diaper genie for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky 
1	diaper champ i have to say that i am very happy with it so far 
1	replacement i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont have to pay out the nose for replacements 
1	use its also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers 
1	champ the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle 
0	function but sometimes if the champ is too full the flip handle wont function 
0	diaper so i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper which i must remove usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full 
1	diaper pail i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it 
1	use the diaper champ couldnt be easier to use 
1	refills and the biggest plus is that you dont have to buy any expensive refills 
1	odor and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained which the diaper genie never did 
1	diaper champ if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained than the diaper champ is the one for you 
1	item use odor this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great 
1	diaper champ diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail 
1	holds it holds a lot of diapers not to mention the odor 
1	use its easy to use 
1	empty its also easy to empty out 
1	garbage bags and best of all no wasting money on special refill bags this takes ordinary garbage bags 
1	diaper pail whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers this is the truly the only diaper pail to get 
1	pail odor even though i never ventured into the cloth land i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life 
0	opening opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it 
1	refills being a very economical person i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills 
0	plunger as one other reviewer pointed out it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the plunger to get the diapers in the pail even though upon inspection the bag doesnt really look full 
1	emptying but from my experience by the time it gets to that point the bag is really heavy so i think this is kind of helpful its a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying 
1	gift this is a really great buy for yourself or as a shower gift 
1	champ go for the champ 
1	product i love this product 
1	dispose with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones

1	refills no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require 
1	product and we still love it 
1	holds holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers 
1	trash bags we use our regular kitchen trash bags cheap 
1	odor holds the odor in nicely 
1	use easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail but that is rare and it usually just means that weve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag 
1	diaper champ we keep the diaper champ in our daughters nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers

1	purchases this is one of the best purchases we made 
1	product use effective great product easy to use economical effective absolutly fabulous 
1	champ update i knew that i loved the champ and useing the diaper genie at a friends house really reinforced that 
1	champ odor there is no comparison the chanp is easy and smell free the genie was difficult to use one handed and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isnt any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ 
1	pail i love this pail 
1	smell ease of use garbage bags no smell easy to use with one hand free and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you dont get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find 
0	diaper pail solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesnt really contain the smell 
0	diaper pail i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another but it is sort of stinky

0	odor but be prepared to buy something else which can trap the odor better 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ is the best

1	noise even did while daughter sleep and no noise 
1	smell i use the scented bags and even if i dont no smell 
1	space this holds alot and does not take up alot of space 
0	top loader we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used 
0	diaper champ we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only 
0	diaper wipes we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped 
1	diaper champ but like i stated its better then a trash can but im not sure if its better then the diaper genie 
1	diapers refills it holds almost a weeks worth of diapers and you dont need expensive refills any kitchen bags work

1	works it works great 
1	smell i cant smell anything 
1	works i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs

1	diaper champ i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie because i didnt like the idea of having to buy special bags 
0	costly too costly and not efficient if you ask me 
1	product this product is a lifesaver 
1	odor i have never had an odor problem 
1	odor no one has ever come to my house and noticed diaper odor 
1	diaper champ in fact people who have been present while i changed my almost month old sons diaper have been amazed at how the very potent smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ 
0	clean you still have to clean the thing 
1	works simple and it works 
0	diaper champ also for those that complain that the diaper champ isnt as effective as time passes keep the following in mind as babies get older their diets changes and so does the smell of their diapers 
1	product price all in all this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price 
1	diaper champ use refills i love the diaper champ it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesnt cost an arm and a leg for refills 
0	pail the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full

0	diapers diapers can get stuck when turned around if you dont tightly wrap them first 
1	product i wanted this product because i didnt have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended 
0	open the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment

1	product i am soooo pleased with this product 
1	investment a wise investment for the pocketbook for the nose 
1	diaper champ diaper champ is great 
1	diaper champ so i cant tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell but its excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby 
1	diaper champ friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well so bought the diaper champ based on on line reviews and i have been happy with it 
1	works it works easily with one hand which is important

0	diaper champ dont buy the diaper champ 
1	pail worked i was using the cheapie pail and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart 
1	product i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point but this prduct seems to work very well so far 
1	pail this one is really great 
1	champ i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did 
1	champ well the champ has survived its first year with our son and it is great 
1	refills the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome 
1	work we just buy the smaller bags that come like to a roll and are sented and they are like and they work great 
1	bags we just recently had to buy another roll of bags so for a year of bags cant beat that 
1	change we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems 
1	diaper pail this is really a nice diaper pail 
1	diaper pail i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers 
1	diaper pail in fact i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now years old that i bought one for our new babys room 
1	diaper pail wow was that disappointing and we didnt even have it months before it broke 
1	diaper champ i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons 
1	refills the diaper champ doesnt require special refills that are expensive and hard to find 
1	work we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully 
1	refills we dont have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail 
1	operated it can be operated with one hand leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table 
1	safer so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation 
1	diaper champ the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle 
1	change bags are easy to change 
0	smell yes you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle but then it is gone 
0	smells to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid 
1	works works great 
1	price the price is right 
1	performed i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the cmt people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed 
0	adjustment the adjustment knob seemed ok but when lowering the router i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob 
0	collet the collet for the inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out 
0	use then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit and i mean just barely 
1	price from the internet woodworking books local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m v hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price 
1	power speed but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large diameter bits 
1	power runs cuts the hitachi has plenty of power runs smooth and cuts effortlessly through maple 
0	bigger heavier use however it is much bigger bulkier and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand 
1	plunge since i use it in a table i dont use the plunge feature but if i ever need it ive got it 
0	use otherwise get a smaller single speed router which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits 
1	looked the hitachi is made in malasyia and looked cheap compared with the makita which is made in the usa 
0	worth if you think you are saving getting the hitachi you are right and you are also getting a router worth less than a makita 
0	pretty it aint cutting edge state of the art with all the latest bells whistles it definitely aint pretty 
1	smooth powerful affordable track record but it is smooth it is powerful it is affordable it has a proven track record 
0	adjustment i built my own router table with a tilt up top made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob these two things make it easy to change out raise or lower the bits 
1	costs router so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models ive got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that 
1	router hitachis m v is a big beast of a router 
0	weight power precise its not the heaviest around but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation 
1	m v in my table the m v has been a real champ 
1	heavy speed the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it 
0	controls with the plungelift all my bit changing has been done above the table although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock 
1	motor start speed price nice things about the m v in a table the powerful hp motor is great soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on continuously variable speed control amazons price 
0	weight power spindle chuck not so nice things a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing the chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping 
1	router this is truly a clydesdale among the industry hp router workhorses 
1	solidity nimble used built like a tank yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig 
1	start the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation 
1	guide the edge guide is top quality easy to install and accurate 
1	speed this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit 
1	adjustment the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy but it works well and provides good accuracy 
0	collet the only complaint i have is that the collet will not sufficiently hold any of my bits 
0	collet the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately 
1	machine this is a great deal and im elated with my decision to go with hitachis green machine 
1	router wish i could give it stars 
1	adjustment collet i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too 
1	speed the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly 
1	guide the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well 
1	accessible the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing 
1	heavy stable it is heavy enough to make it stable but not too heavy to preclude hand use 
0	plunge the plunge action isnt smooth unless you make it so 
0	instructions the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rpms of the speed settings were mentioned 
0	fit finish also the fit and finish could be better although this doesnt detract from performance 
1	price overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase 
1	money this is an excellent router for the money 
0	plunge the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust 
0	springs i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much 
1	money other than that i think it is the best router for the money 
1	router i must have gotten a good one 
1	adjustment control collet i dont have problems with the depth adjustment the speed control the collet 
1	hitachi i would put the hitachi up with the best 
1	vibration no vibration 
1	plunging smooth plunging it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant 
1	router adjustment it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely 
1	shaft it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great 
1	balance lighter very good balance in the hands and lighter than most hp models 
1	start the soft start is nice 
1	price the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachis incentive 
1	price the total price with delivery was 
1	cheap less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer 
1	price saw the hitachi on amazon com with their coupon and could not resist trying it out 
1	operate unlike other reviewers i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table 
1	switch lock both the on off switch and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand 
1	heavy router it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried 
0	spring your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism 
0	spring mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it 
0	sawdust i have noted that as you use the tool sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention 
0	sawdust not a killer problem but not well done either 
1	use result for me it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high quality result 
1	price can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain 
1	m after getting used to the m all the rest seemed lacking 
1	router plunge on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable it is just a plunge router that works really well 
1	use i use it in the table in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances 
0	slop the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged 
0	big if it werent so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers 
1	router what an upgrade 
1	starts runs i have only used it with the collet and a round over bit but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly 
1	adjustment the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m v than it was on my old router 
1	use vibration the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration 
1	price combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box and im really happy 
1	router im sure i dont use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers but i really like it 
1	router i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot 
1	stable use visibility i find it very stable and comfortable to use it doesnt jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control and it has very good visibility to see your cut 
1	fence it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and wont break 
1	controls also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesnt have any extra knobs or gizmos 
1	simple i prefer things that are simple 
1	power control the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut and the speed control knob is easy to get to 
0	guide i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it 
0	springs i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise 
0	adjustments i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments but i seldom use it 
0	wrench i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table 
1	system its not a perfect system but its a very good one 
1	router ive owned this router for over years and am somewhat satisfied with it 
1	quiet power it is quiet and has plenty of power 
1	stability weight i find that it is stable in my hands and its weight actually contributes to that stability 
0	plunging that said i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism 
0	shafts shortly after i brought it the plunging shafts started sticking 
0	shafts after repeatly cleaning and recleaning it still stuck after using it for a little while 
0	plunge i no longer use it as a plunge router only as a stationary or table mounted router 
0	plunging if the plunging action is critical to your work look elsewhere 
1	performance features i love the performance and features of this router 
1	money for the money im not sure you can do better 
1	quiet adjustment speed its very quiet for a universal motor driven tool and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great 
1	plunging smooth plunging mechanism 
1	fence the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid 
0	grip chuck collet its oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router activate the chuck lock and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up 
1	router performer even with that i highly recommend this router outstanding performer 
1	router i purchased two of these beauties 
1	router i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router 
1	router one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for years without a problem 
1	collets the design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman routers i have previously purchased 
1	collets power they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered 
1	money i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper 
1	setup the setup works awesome as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for its merits and not just the company as a whole 
1	router i would however highly recommend the m v router 
1	hitachi m v im not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m v it turns out that now im very fond of it 
1	operation speed the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good jasada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results 
1	router its well made and user friendly 
1	router youll love it 
1	router it is currently permanently mounted in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot 
1	start runs this router has soft start and runs smooth and true 
1	router i use the router with a in raised panel bit with no problems 
1	power it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish 
1	price for the price i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup 
1	router you just cant go wrong with this one 
1	router enjoy 
1	price this is an excellent router for the price 
1	router the first one lasted about years of heavy use 
1	tool powerful this is a well made and powerful tool 
0	price i was some what sceptical when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible hp 
1	m v the m v has been great 
1	adjustment the height adjustment works well not perfect 
1	bog the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog 
1	quite workload cheap what i really like about its quite it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking 
0	router this router was a huge disapointment 
0	adjustment the depth adjustment was sloppy 
0	control the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool to effect any speed change 
0	control it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers 
0	control my son tried it and he too couldnt change the speed without an assist 
1	heft i did like the heft of the machine 
0	router control i sent it back as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective 
0	router all in all not very good 
1	power the power is incredible it cut through mdf and plywood like butter 
1	adjust the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well 
0	adjustment the only not so positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment it is not easy to micro adjust accurately 
1	price router i do not count this as a negative however because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up 
1	router the ones ive kept have proven their worth over the years however when i need a real workhorse i grab this router 
1	machine i recently had to run a straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didnt even slow down 
1	router i could take passes and it still didnt skip a beat 
1	hitachi ive yet to find the limitation for this hitachi and quite frankly i dont know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder 
1	price bottom line is that at this is an absolute steal 
1	router ive got a buddy whos trying to offload his almost new speedmatic because he saw what this router can do 
1	router it is without even a slight doubt my new favorite 
1	starts speeds depth power the hitachi m v is a dream to work with smooth starts adjustable speeds micro adjustable depth and plenty of power to spare 
1	router i couldnt believe what i had been missing 
1	router if youre looking for a hp plunge router the hitachi m v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget 
1	router ill be getting a second one for my router table 
1	power i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m v 
1	bog it doesnt bog down under load 
1	cuts cuts are easy and smooth 
1	works i use it on a router table and it is works well 
0	adjustment the major reasons i didnt give it a five are one i didnt think the fine adjustment worked well 
0	adjustment i replaced it with a router raizer and it works much better 
0	wrench two the single wrench just doesnt work well 
0	latch the sliding latch is does not stay in place 
1	router other than this i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again 
1	price i really liked the price 
1	control i like the speed control 
1	power it has plenty of power 
0	adustment knob the fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table 
0	router razier finally i gave up and i purchased a router razier

1	apple thank you apple you make fabulous products 
1	product the product i rate five stars

1	amazon plus if you order from amazon com they will exchange it for you no problem 
0	interface the interface took a little getting used to 
1	display this one has a color display which i like a lot being very visual 
1	photos i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and very importantly the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous 
1	sound the sound is just fine 
1	adapter it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall which i hear is a step up from the other ipods which require you plug it into a computer to charge it 
0	photo quality one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved 
1	hard drive affordable pros large hard drive for the gb and gb are both affordable 
1	screen decently sized screen one of the larger ones on the market at

1	firewire usb firewire usb for those fortunate enough to have firewire your in for a real treat with autosync

1	sound durable compact good sound plays very nicely even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable not the most durable because its mostly plastic but very compact and sturdy 
1	games games not really important but existant 
1	hold hold button suprisingly not all mp s have this this allows you to have all the buttons unusable so that you dont accidently hit something in your pocket 
0	radio tuner cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of competetors are doing 
0	voice recorder no voice recorder this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesnt have 
0	memory stick slots battery no memory stick slots although a rare feature it would be nice to have extra storage not that it needs it built in lithium battery a huge hassle to bring this back draining the battery once you get it helps but removable replaceable ones are a lot more convenient 
1	itunes itunes this is a love hate relationship program usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc but depending on your computer expertise this could be a difficult program to use and it is required for an ipod 
0	accessories no inbox accessories an arm strap belt strap case or anything would be nice but nope moveable parts this makes me almost want to keep my rd gen over a th with moveable parts its easy to damage an ipod at a gym so this is for more casual listeners note the ipod mini doesnt have moveable parts and is made of titanium 
1	overall comments overall this is still a great value but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market 
1	versatile versatile and stylish 
1	design capacity connection options itunes i had a casio unit which had given great service and would have been happy to get another one but was tempted by the ipods sleek design storage capacity connection options firewire and usb and its integration with itunes

1	controls the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed 
1	ipod the ipod is a very nice product which given reasonable care should give a lot of service 
0	ipod first let me say that i got the gb ipod for christmas and i most likely would not have spent the myself

1	quality i have about gb used on my ipod so far and as far as i can tell all of them play at near cd quality 
1	interface use other than the fact that one cant delete a file directly from the ipod the interface is excellent and mind numbingly simple to use

0	battery the battery does not last hours 
0	battery you cant change the battery so i dont know what im going to do in a year or so

0	apple if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged they charge you roughly per minute and blame you for abusing your ipod 
0	support service the user support service isnt too great either 
1	ipod everything i wanted the apple ipod has become one of the most sought after electronic gadgets and for good reason 
1	design capacity itunes its sleek design large memory capacity compatibility with itunes and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market 
1	capacity unless you have an enormous music audio book library the gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity with a stated ability to hold songs 
1	wheel backlighting itunes features click wheel to navigate ability to work with windows or mac optional backlighting ability to download pda info automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer 
1	equalizer theres even an equalizer that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic bass booster bass reducer classical dance deep and electronic

1	battery battery non issue 
1	ipod use finally compare the ipod to other players on a cost gb and also consider ease of use 
1	ipod the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market

0	itunes as a windows user i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance 
1	ipod i still give the ipod five stars though as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install so ill give apple the benefit of the doubt 
1	battery the battery holds a charge for a very long time so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use 
0	outside finish my only complaint is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesnt get all scratched up 
1	quality of audio controls capacity i recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive and the storage capacity and battery life are huge 
1	itunes using the software itunes is relatively simple you just plug the usb cable in wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfered on over to the ipod 
1	amplifier and with the ipods full volume up all you have to do is adjust your receivers volume and your set since the ipod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its own 
0	proprietary if there were any complaints i have they are marginal but one is apples properietary set up for music files their incompatibility with other music services is down right wrong 
1	ipod however after purchasing a gb ipod its clear to see the superiority 
1	ipod interface design for a sleeker smaller and more average mp player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful 
0	play wma also some other mp players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma files whereas the ipod does not 
1	using the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent 
1	design the design as mentioned above is sleek cool and trendy 
1	battery the battery life lastes hours and charges quickly once youve downloaded your music you can access the tracks by artist genre album composer etc 
1	sound quality the sound quality is great 
1	earphones the included earphones are pretty good my advice 
1	use the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute 
1	hard drive with the ipod you can also store documents and contact files when its connected to your pc as an external hard drive 
1	games also included in the games section is the great music trivia option which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs 
1	storage space gb or gb the pros of the gb comes with a dock station and double storage space 
1	ipod capacity price overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast the capacity in the gb is more than i think most people would ever need and for the price i highly recommend it 
1	itunes design everything else about the ipod is great the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it 
1	finding finding all the albums songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have gig worth of music 
1	sounds it all sounds great too 
0	headphones as with most headphones that come with any type of music player i recommend throwing these into the nearest river unless you like having hard round pieces of plastic in your ears 
1	store you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it 
0	battery because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unreplacable month battery 
0	batteries this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freakin easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries 
0	pay however in my mind is a lot to pay for a device that will only last months 
0	interface looks and durability i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface 
0	scratches the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousins player was relatively new it was riddled with scratches 
0	battery battery compared to the other players on the market the ipod has one of the worst batteries around 
1	ipod if like me you simply want an ipod to play your mp s buy this one 
1	reliability so reliability is the winner here for the ipod 
1	looks for looks well ipod is head and shoulders better both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod 
1	package the ipod package comes with everything you need the ac adaptor firewire cable those snazzy and powerfull headphones and of course the player 
0	design maybe this new design is more durable than the last but i kind of doubt it 
0	scratch we can start by losing the shiny miracle material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong and thus eliminate the need for third party iskin protective covers for an extra thirty bucks 
0	earbuds first of all ive never been big on earbuds theyre just not that comfortable 
1	ipod these issues aside the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one you cant be without one 
0	alternative and if youre a mac user like me theyve naturally made sure you have no viable alternative 
1	itunes also you have to use it with itunes or theyll sue dammit but itunes is about as good as anything 
1	player the player is great 
0	battery however the battery life isnt as good as i would like 
1	product overall this product is awesome 
1	features all the cool features of the mini but with gb instead of

1	use i have transferred in about tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes 
1	sound quality i was worried about what the sound quality would be like but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound 
0	screen this is only a problem at night during the day the screen is very easy to see 
1	features i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it 
0	battery the only problem is the battery life 
0	battery apples ipod battery replacement service costs 
1	arm band the arm band is fantastic and it doesnt budge even at the gym 
1	design i love the slim design the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky 
1	sound the ear buds that come with it look cheap but the sound quality is amazing 
1	click wheel the click wheel is incredibly convenient however it can be a little overly touchy at times which will make you frustrated with your own fingers 
1	itunes i am a big fan of itunes simply because it is terribly fast and convenient if you are buying the songs from the itunes site 
1	apple way to go apple 
1	ipod i rarely get drawn in by mass commercialism but something about the ipod made me say in the words of lou and andy i want that one i was willing to shell out 
0	instruction unfortunately creative offered scant few pages of instruction which meant that i was on own from the outset 
0	touch pad navigate after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch pad system i could not get the unit to download my wma files 
0	explain so you might inquire why dont they make it a first priority to carefully simply explain how download music from your music library to their device this seems academic to me 
0	navigating most of us just want to plug and play not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing 
1	sound all of this said the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod 
1	bass highs the base was deeper and the highs were crisper 
0	touch pad instruction unfortunately the touch pad issues and poor instruction guide killed it 
1	machine what a kick butt mp machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source instead of paying for them two or three times then get the creative zen ipod killer kiss my ass itunes 
0	zen micro this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another 
0	software who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a foreign computer just to move over some simple files 
1	sound portability the sound is great the portability etc all the stuff you expect from a good mp player this zen micro has it 
0	button sensitivity button sensitivity even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting the buttons are far two sensitive really takes some getting use to and even then it is still too sensitive 
0	feature recharge cord worst feature possible this alone makes it rate one star whats up with no recharge cord 
0	cost you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost 
0	charged i took my zen micro with me over the weekend and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged 
0	product i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone 
0	prices creative inc the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices 
0	case the box included a little polyester pull string bag and tries to pass it off as the case 
0	case if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip on carrier for you zen micro expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time 
1	battery one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup 
1	rechargeable battery creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature 
1	fm receiver the zen micro fm receiver is ok not great 
0	fm receiver iriver has a better fm receiver built in but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed 
1	constructed the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed hefty if you will far better than many of its competitors 
0	charges as i wrote this could have been a great product but expect hidden charges as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage 
1	zen micro well i have an ipod mini and i really like it but all in all i like the zen micro more 
1	size space battery look smaller size gb of more space radio voice recording removable battery cooler look all in one

1	small i love how small the thing is and the blue glow ive had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all 
1	media source file transfers creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it and the file transfers are fast 
1	sound fm tuner recorder sound quality is great fm tuner is fine as is the recorder 
1	player this is the mp player with everything i need as long as it lasts me a good three years im satisfied 
1	player also if you want a device that does soo much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price this is the player for you 
0	headphones and supply those stupid white headphones 
1	small upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp player 
1	installation the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software windows media player or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch 
0	touch pad the touch pad does take a little getting used to 
1	cable adapter headphones stand pouch the package also comes with a usb cable an ac adapter a pair of headphones a stand and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in 
1	zen touch overall im incredibly impressed with my new zen touch 
1	looks its cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges 
1	player for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp player 
1	player ive had this player for more than months and im very happy with it 
1	speakers speakers at home i rarely use it with the earbuds though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp players 
1	look feel the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience 
1	feels it feels tiny in the hand without it 
1	stand the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk 
1	looks read the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read 
0	touch controls the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldnt change it for the scroll wheel 
1	touch buttons the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdont slip which was very thoughtful 
1	build reliability build i dropped the player once from about ft and it fell hard but kept on playing 
1	hardcase the hardcase they give with it must work well 
1	solid it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon 
1	sound sound im no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too 
1	sound i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright 
1	sound best of all the wmas sound great 
1	features utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list 
1	recorded the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal 
0	software software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it it does the job well 
1	playlists creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean 
0	battery life there are things that need fixing first is the battery life it will run for hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons 
0	usb second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the pc during play which is a bit irritating 
1	creative zen i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good 
0	headphone jack however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal every day use 
1	support the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges i had a new zen 
0	organization i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders 
1	sound the sound is quite good in terms of volume 
0	headphones the headphones are not very comfortable but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have 
1	installation touch pad i didnt have any installation problems and the touch pad is fine even if it is sort of inaccurate 
1	cheaper wma files i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files 
1	price all in all its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use 
0	software feature the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered and excludes my favorite feature in itunes the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder 
0	player nagatives of the player itself you need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player 
0	sensitivy even on the low sensitivy level a slight touch can skip or pause the track 
0	player this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing 
1	battery the battery is removable 
1	fm radio fm radio built in 
1	microphone record memos using the built in microphone

1	storage you can use it as a storage hard drive 
1	itunes i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro 
0	made first thing i noticed was that the creative wasnt well made 
0	player one drop from a pocket or desktop and itd be a goner 
0	sound problems with the sound quality were evident right away but even i couldnt imagine theyd be that bad 
0	eq bass the eq is awful and even at top volumes the bass is flat sounding 
0	volume cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality 
0	headphone jack the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sonys id been having 
0	sound if youve been listening to cds in your car for awhile dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to 
1	car adapter however if there was one thing i liked about the creative it would be the car adapter 
0	storage even after all the nightmare sound problems id still half way like this product if it kept its promise the ability to store songs 
0	storage i got about loaded up before it told me i was full and at that point i was ready to toss it out the window 
0	creative my friend has an ipod and although the sound quality probably wont meet most audiophile standards the product itself is better than anything creative has made 
0	features it holds a promised amount of songs and the headphone jack volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creatives 
0	player however this one makes an ipod sound like your old lps so even if youre a casual listener id advise that you avoid the purchase of this product terrible 
1	compatibility with windows media player while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini because i am not an apple person never has been i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player 
1	format also the wma compression format is superior to mp especially at lower bit rates so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers 
1	accessories i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories 
1	zen micro and so far i have been very very happy with my zen micro 
1	working its being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers 
1	features user interface the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface 
1	feel what i like the most small and solid feel 
1	size feel the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures and feels very solid 
1	backlight the blue backlight is pretty cool 
1	screen touchpad the screen is clear and readable and the touch pad works very well it took me less than a day to get the hang of it and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control 
1	sound audio quality great sound i was very impressed i encode at kbps and the audio quality is great especially with the better headphones 
1	transfer sync with media player the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast 
1	battery replaceable battery 
1	interface with the right firmware drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive 
1	player i have not yet used all the features like the calendar etc but as a music player this little thing rocks 
0	battery life the only reason for not giving it stars the claimed battery life of hours is very optimistic possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for hours without ever touching the player but in real life i can probably get hours at most 
0	battery life even the shorter battery life though has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way 
1	warranty price accessories player if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty this is the player to get highly recommended 
1	price the micro seeemed like an ipod for less 
1	sound pros excellent sound even with the headphones that come out of the box but it absolutely rocked with my bose quietcomfort set 
1	look size looks sleek compact has a radio 
0	accessories limitations not a lot of original accessories like the ipod 
0	battery life the battery life leaves a lot to be desired 
0	firmware i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem but it hasnt worked 
0	outlook sync the outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people several people complained about the touchpad and frankly im starting to see why 
0	touchpad i occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly 
0	audible com book compatibility not compatible with audible com books 
0	zen micro overall it does its basic function very well but we expect more from the mp players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occassion 
1	player dont worry this player rocks 
1	appeal it was also the most appealing 
1	packing for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out well presented and easy to open and put back together 
1	casing it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside 
1	case a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering 
1	design i do give create to creative for their attractive design

1	fm tuner fm tuner microphone having a tuner in the player is a blessing

1	player thankfully creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place 
1	zen micro while i have not had the privilege as many call it of owning an ipod based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones 
1	player by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch 
1	zen micro while im not too keen on their customer service i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth 
1	look size battery life about the product the zen micro is a sleek stylish device that caters not just to hip youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life size or the awkward factor 
1	size design it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well designed doesnt look to ostentatious while im walking around with it

1	battery life battery life is exceptional lasting longer than the hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market 
1	file transfer software transferring files couldnt be easier thanks to the included software bundle 
1	organizer software also i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software which i had with audigy zs sound card originally it is definitely an added plus 
1	design features all in all creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype 
0	configuration p s the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power after connecting it to the rear ports it works perfectly 
0	player the ipod mini is smaller and sexier albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value 
0	storage format the karma is only more its small had a gig drive and supports more formats including ogg 
1	functioning initially i was very impressed after loading songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright 
0	auto load after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didnt do anything but turn on my player 
0	software it seems like the software is just not responding 
0	support the support has been less than impressive considering the cost 
0	support im going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through a refund should be twice as frustrating 
1	storage battery features the extra gb of hardrive space removeable battery and fm tuner as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me 
1	working fortunately for me i have yet to have a single problem with this player 
1	interface controls i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although ill admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so 
1	manual however there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro 
0	software while the software may not be as easy as i tunes it is not difficult to use by any stretch 
1	loading speed as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player the songs load extremely fast about one or two seconds per song 
1	editing titles i also like the fact that you can edit your mp titles etc 
1	sound after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md e lps and sennheiser mx s i find myself still using the creatives which in my opinion sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord 
0	fm reception if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway so you can take that for what its worth 
1	zen micro overall im very pleased with the zen micro and based on my experience with it can recommend it without reservation 
0	functioning it had issues right off the bat with freezing up staying in ishutting down mode and just not functioning very well in general 
0	touch pad access the touch pad would be a great thing if it worked well and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player i did have problems accessing them from the player 
0	make many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well 
0	player it is the first generation of the player and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck 
0	player if someone asked me flat out id say to go woth something else 
1	price design perhaps i bought the micro to be different the cheaper price tag the design or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways 
1	player whichever it may be im happy ive made this purchase 
1	size when i opened the box i was shocked by the size of this thing its tiny 
1	look size its shorter sleeker more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy 
1	interface trim the interface has a sassier flair and the blue lit trimming is an added bonus 
1	sound moving on to sound department it delivers 
0	earbuds ive since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable but are too similar to ipods and can target ipod theives here in nyc 
0	design although i thought it couldve been designed a bit better 
1	extra features there are extra features packed inside this unit such as fm radio tuner voice recorder calendar and alarm clock 
1	battery usage speaking of battery its removable and replaceable 
1	micro overall the micro is a solid device and i havent fell into a problem with it yet knocks on wood 
0	storage its perfect for those who arent planning on storing tons of music 
1	music transfer transferring music is a breeze i dont subscribe to music services but as mentioned on other reviews micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes 
1	features sound quality it may not top the ipod mini but its definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality 
1	design size comfort look strong points design small comfortable curved and stylish 
1	variety of colours colors variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from 
1	sound you dont need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a special edition to get black sound awesome batteries removable replaceable 
1	audio formats audio formats supports both mp wma and yeah wav too 
0	touch pad design volume control weak points touch pad design could be better volume control controlled through the vertical strip but purchasing a headphone with built in volume control will do the trick 
0	fm reception radio quality weak reception 
0	color touchpad the colors are a joke and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad 
0	design but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design 
0	software still has terrible software 
0	software you have to wonder why creative cant get this right 
1	storage you do get more gb than an ipod mini 
0	screen review screen review could be better 
0	screen review apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a gig mini 
1	player this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price 
1	storage cost the g ipod costs the same as this g zen micro 
1	features it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately 
1	design creative did an awesome job with the design 
1	headphones extra accessories the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it that i know doesnt come with every one 
1	player i have the black one and adore it 
1	look background light it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black 
0	touchpad the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i dont like how the scroll button is the same button used as an enter key but you get used to it and it isnt a big deal 
1	size style i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini 
1	player overall ive been very impressed with the player 
1	functioning ive had almost no problems with the firmware but i have kept the player up to date 
1	firmware im not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li ion battery the better firmware or a combination of both factors 
1	battery life i imagine if i left my player untouched it could play for considerably more than hours at a low volume level 
1	sync to windows media player one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player 
1	speed look its just as fast as the included creative software but much less invasive and overall better looking 
1	touchpad the touchpad is great once you get used to it and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels 
1	touchpad also the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree 
0	fm reception the fm radios reception isnt spectacular but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area 
1	radio record its ability to record radio is useful as well but would have been moreso if it could be preset 
1	look feel sound the player looks great feels great and sounds great 
1	durability so far it has been very durable but those arent really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own 
1	earbuds they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonics and sennheisers 
1	built ive dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces and it still works flawlessly 
1	zen micro this year it seems that i choose my timing perfectly having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro 
1	features everything that i have listed above the zen has and more 
1	navigation the menus are easy to scroll through they are laid out naturally and make sense 
1	interface the computer interface is good only losing points due to the fact that creative branding is all over the place within it 
1	transfer speed battery life songs transfer lightning fast and the two batteries that came in my box give me hours of listen time 
1	features on the fly play list creation address book removable storage drive capabilities sound recorder the list goes on people this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies it was like halloween all over again 
1	design ease ofuse so far i have used all of the above mentioned features and find them well designed and easy to understand 
0	zen good though and the zen does have a few drawbacks 
0	file transfer while transferring songs to the player the interface has crashed a few times normally this would cause me major concern but it appears that this bug is reproducible which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly 
0	response speed another thing i dont like is that some of the features take seconds to load up 
1	plaeyr thats it for now what are you doing still reading this click the add to cart button already 
1	features sound quality music source support right out of the box i loved it better features than the ipod great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use 
1	player so i was one who was ready to give it stars with no complaints at all 
0	warranty after consulting with creatives customer support they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair which would cost me since its past the day warranty 
0	working well i got my second player and right out of the box it wasnt working right and once again after consulting customer se 
0	quality reliability they obviously have quality and reliability problems 
0	player they have a good concept here and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative so maybe they will do better with the next gen version but for now i say buyer beware 
1	player original review december im sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro but mine has worked great 
1	player this is my first mp player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do 
1	sound rip i have ripped over songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast and they all sound great 
0	interface es the interface took a little getting used to but once i did its almost second nature now 
1	organization i love that you can create custom playlists and organize music in so many different ways 
0	wav format only slight negatives ive had so far is that i havent been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet 
0	case my other nit is that it didnt include at least some kind of carrying case for everything 
0	belt clip yes there is a belt clip but that doesnt hold the extra battery and usb cable 
0	bag the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless 
0	bag it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart 
1	player i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it 
0	player it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it 
1	features the fm tuner the g of storage and the removable disk are all great features 
0	interface on the downside i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software 
0	software is not as intuitive as i would like 
0	earbuds also the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable so i bought a pair of over the ear headphones 
1	player overall i am very pleased with it 
1	player the more i use it and figure out how to do things the more i like it 
1	sound quality before you run out and buy an ipod understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle principally excellent sound quality 
1	headphones the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds 
1	size the player is smaller than you think 
0	touchpad the touch pad is over sensitive and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive 
1	sound quality music subscription service bottom line if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services and are willing to deal with the possibility of setup gremlins by all means get the zen micro 
0	software the machine itself seems fine but the software that came with it is awful 
0	player after installation the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions it totally shorted out 
0	working i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work to no avail 
0	customer support of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative through their website and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless 
0	player his is what i get for my on this mp player 
1	zen micro the zen micro is near perfect 
1	built its still alive still kicking and still playing 
1	windows compatibility the zen micro has a lot going for it 
1	size sound quality interface look battery features it fits into a hand well it has a removable battery great sound quality fm stereo recorder smooth ui and a feature that most unipods lack char 
0	work with wmp it wouldnt always work seemlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it 
1	accessories the accesories that come with the player are great 
1	bag white earbuds a case a stand a clip and a nice little zen micro bag 
1	player best in class 
1	player it gives you the most bang for your buck period 
1	quality creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and yes charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie 
1	player pick your favorite color and buy it 
0	touch sensitivity as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front 
0	durability putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything second im worried about the durability of the player 
0	durability after research of other creative hard drive players i found that most of them arent very durable and tend to crash 
0	price last i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this 
1	design color pros the design is very nice and the colors are too 
1	features it also has tons more features then previous creative products and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want not the default items 
1	battery the battery is also convenient but could have been better such as the zen touchs battery 
0	storage verdict had i not needed something with a tad bit more space i consider this player fair game 
1	player if you dont mind all the buttons being touch sensitive id recomment buying it to try out and also buy an extra year warrenty for it 
1	player anyway my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing 
1	firmware the program is called gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does 
1	look size accessories looks snazzy smaller than a pack of smokes easily transported ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter usb cable 
1	battery life sound quality battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet awesome sound quality i mean it is creative right 
1	navigation sorts music by artist album genre etc its easy to wade through gigs of tunes to find what youre looking for 
0	scrollpad it does take some getting used to 
0	charging whatever on to the negatives touchy about charging you can damage the battery and seriously decrease its life if you dont upgrade the firmware or dont heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side 
0	button functioning it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working 
0	users guide users guide doesnt cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website 
0	heat cant be left in the car it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long 
1	size but since its so small it isnt a big deal to bring it with me 
1	player overall though im very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp player even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod 
1	napster go compatibility i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster go which is a subscription service allowing me to download as much music as i want for a flat fee 
1	player and i must say this mp is very cool 
1	look its so cute and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue 
1	installation after installation which was very simple i downloaded any updated software from the creative website before i downloaded any music 
1	sound the sound is very nice 
1	lock feature i also like the lock feature so it makes the touch pad inactive 
0	fm reception i tried to use the fm radio option but it doesnt seem to really pick up the stations i listen however i am going to try it in a different location it may have just been my residential location 
0	touchpad even when i set it to low its still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do 
1	player otherwise i am extremely please with the creative zen micro gb mp player 
1	zen micro however after playing with it for three weeks now im convinced the zen micro is superior 
1	sound quality i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality with no need to upgrade the earphones 
1	fm tuner i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill concerts and programs being simulcast npr and on and on 
0	scroll bar ive read about the issues with the scroll bar but they must have taken care of that now 
1	ease of usage mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download 
1	size look its also smaller and gets more looks 
1	extra features an extra gig of room fm radio voice recorder pim applications with sync to outlook 
1	player this is really a no brainer 
1	buy the zen 
1	features i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features extra g storage wma support replaceable battery and especially that it wasnt an apple product with their proprietary architecture 
0	touchpad the touchpad is virtually unusable sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you dont want 
0	download speed another problem is that the latest firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player which seems to be very very slow for downloads charging also note that it doesnt seem to charge when connected to the pc only when plugged into an ac socket even though they both connect to the single usb port on the player so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music 
1	outlook compatibility better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility 
1	software tech support accessories creative has excellent music software a very responsive tech support group and usually a good array of accessories 
1	additional accesories the zen micro is no exception in addition to the case it comes with a neck strap and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging 
1	player if i could id trade up on my creative muvo and snag a zen micro tomorrow 
1	player portability size this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks 
1	plug in i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the stores sound system 
1	features headphones feature for feature i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system between this and th larger zen ihardly use my home stereo system anymore 
0	napster to go compatibility if you buying this player to use with napster to go wait a while 
0	firmware a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it 
1	player on the whole im quite happy with the purchase 
1	sound storage the sound is bright and clear the ability to store any mp s is great and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time 
1	look comfort weight interface the device looks very cool i think its comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice 
1	srorage no offense to amazon but i was able to find one online for just over bucks and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space 
1	radio feature i like some local stations stern and npr and so the radio seemed like a great option 
0	fm reception imagine my disappointment though when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area 
0	fm reception it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound 
0	battery life the battery as others have said also seems weaker than creative suggests 
0	creative still thats enough time that im still satisfied if a bit grouchy with creatives overhyped promises 
1	headphones have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility 
1	player as i said i dont regret the purchase at all 
1	zen micro eball metaphor i was hoping creative hit a home run here and i think the zen micro is more like a stand up double 
0	player respectable solid but not awe inspiring 
1	sound quality battery life capacity look construction price compatibility actually the creative zen micro solves all that 
1	sound quality sound quality phenomenal 
1	sound quality earbuds unarguably better than apples and nice earbuds to boot 
1	variety of colors your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package 
1	storage five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums 
1	construction tough as nails 
1	construction no skips and it hasnt faltered once despite your inevitable drop or two 
1	compatibility flawless 
1	play wma no locked in proprietary business like apple this baby plays wmas too 
1	voice record player the voice recorder is a beautiful add on not even necessary but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player 
1	sound gets nice sound too 
1	fm tuner the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake 
1	player in conclusion this player is beautiful 
1	ease of use power power for the tech savvy ease of use for the less fortunate 
1	player but it you wont regret it 
1	player functioning touchpad this player is absolutely phenomenal i havent had any problems and if youre worried you will have problems i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways i find the touch pad very easy to use and im surprised so many people have had problems 
1	sound quality the sound quality is superb much better than that of an ipod in my opinion 
1	radio the radio works excellent in my area im not sure everywhere else 
1	software file transfer speed the software is very easy to use and the transfer is super fast 
1	battery dj features im not gonna go into the features cause if youre reading this review youve probably already looked at them but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus 
1	look the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also 
1	price player t simply the best player on the market for a really low price so why look anywhere else 
1	player ive had it for about a week now and have to say its one of the best purchases ive ever made 
1	look ease of use sound quality its a great looking easy to use device but its the sound quality which is truly amazing far better than my sony mini disc player 
1	interface touchpad i have no problems with the touch pad and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual 
1	media player compatibility why bother when it works perfectly with media player 
0	battery life where close to hours but at least it is replaceable 
0	battery life i would give it about or hours although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles 
1	storage the extra gb is just a bonus 
0	headphones the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of ear buds 
1	sound if your looking for a great sounding mini player you cant go wrong with the zen micro 
0	player unfortunately i was wrong 
0	player within one month my player completely died 
0	touchpad buttons this time the touch screen wouldnt respond to me and none of the buttons worked 
0	working so i took out the battery and put it back in again only to find that it would not work 
0	sound i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played 
0	customer service i sent creative customer service emails in which they did not help me one bit and dont seem to even want to help 
1	design it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design 
0	player its too bad though that 
1	zen micro the creative zen micro at first glance is a dream come true for all mp and music lovers 
1	battery the zen offered a great alternative 
1	software its easy to use and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch 
1	sound quality the clarity is unbelievable which means you can cram almost the full 
1	sound quality other mp players wont give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level so i imagine they wont at lower ones either 
0	headphones the included headphones suck so get your own 
1	trnasfer transfering mp s are a cinch with the included software 
1	format the zen plays mp wma and wave formats which makes it more versatile than the ipod 
1	software the greatest thing about the software is that it reads your cd info 
1	organization track name artist album and genre is automatically retrieved via internet labeled and properly catergorized into the zen 
1	labling rks almost without fail no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock to hip hop to korean and japanese to afro cuban and salsa jazz blues country and pop this feature performs well 
0	touch screen the touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to but once you do and while the zen is still alive its a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies 
0	fm reception just too numerous to list fm radio which has weak reception but at least it there and a microphone to name just two 
1	touchpad light oh and another is the cool halo light that surrounds the touch pad and lights up when you touch the screen and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer 
0	design but the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw and im going to tell you what it is but first two more things about this piece of garbage thats so great and couldve made it a potenial ipod killer 
1	size storage one its size its smaller than the ipod mini and holds more music 
1	battery two it has a removeable rechargeable battery so you dont have to send the thing in when the re 
0	design but all of this means nothing because of the serious serious stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw after months give or take a few weeks you wont be able to hear anything 
0	headphone jack design because the engineers at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack 
0	headphone jack again the headphone jack on this thing is garbage 
0	headphone design again this is a design flaw in the headphone 
0	zen the flaw is inside the zen 
0	headphone jack the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to 
0	zen micro the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer not an ipod killer 
0	storage why would anyone buy this when you can get a gb ipod that will hold times the number of songs for the same price 
1	audio quality ease of use features this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality ease of use and features 
0	usage with subscription service to use the creative zen player with a subscription service you need to go to creatives web site and download new software for your pc 
0	set up i havent seen any problems yet but if you dont like to tinker a bit this player can be a little challenging to set up 
0	transfer speed right now the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly 
0	subscription wma this doesnt affect standard mp files just subscription wma files 
0	transfer speed the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer but its only by about or so 
0	subscription drm encoded again this doesnt affect regular mp files just subscription drm encoded files like those from napster to go or yahoo music unlimited 
1	player otherwise this is a great alternative mp player for those of use who dont want to worship the mighty all powerful apple 
1	player i got it to use with the new per month service from yahoo and despite the above issues i love it 
1	creative i have owned some kind of creative audio product since and have never had to call tech support 
1	player the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily 
1	interface storage battery life it beats apple on the storage space it beats apple on the removable battery and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel 
1	audio quality further the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod 
1	player i have had several mp players over the past few years and have to say that this by far is the best that ive owned 
1	features however the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the zen micro has to offer 
1	storage battery life extra features some features that the zen micro has that sold me on my purchase include a g hard drive actually an sd flash card drive very large and much more than actually needed the ability to sync with microsoft outlooks calendar the long battery life of about to hours i can change the battery myself for about to buy vs 
1	construction sound quality microphone sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about the ability to record with a built in microphone very sturdy construction and not to mention the sound quality is excellent 
1	user interface as far as user interface is concerned the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player creative mediasource organizer 
1	converter this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another 
1	formats these include mp wave wma wma pro and wma lossless it is very user friendly simply by right clicking the file to be converted 
1	creative zen micro by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money if you are undecided the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice 
0	on off i dont know maybe i got a defective one but first the player would not shut off next the player would not come on i had to send it away to get repaired 
0	ear phone jack now the players ear phone jack is not working i have to send it away again 
1	player when its working its great but it is very tempermental 
1	phone ive had this beauty for nearly months now and i truely love it 
0	battery life the only disappointment so far has been battery life 
0	battery life mine generally requires a charege every hours or so and i dont really talk on it that much 
1	phone it has it all 
1	phone this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen infrared bluetooth usb connector and a speakerphone 
1	phone if you are looking for an upgrade this is definitely the phone for you 
1	size had similar features but that is big in size 
1	looks and feels nice 
1	bluetooth this one is full of features 
1	lcd camera quality especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around 
1	pda i have set up its pda features with avantgo com where you can download info from sites like weather mapquest maps directions into it which is great 
1	s w using supplied s w you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it 
1	battery life goes days after a charge 
0	phone i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available 
0	priced i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time 
1	phone i must add to the dismay delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held 
1	use it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight 
1	keypad the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer 
1	keypad believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the has the best keypad 
1	look i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be 
1	interface the nokia has a brilliant java interface 
1	mmc card the phone offers a mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature 
1	capacity capacity is not a problem here 
1	build the build is just right 
1	sturdy the phone is sturdy 
1	build ive dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever 
1	phone its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it 
1	phone this isnt the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this are you 
1	camera the camera installed on this phone is awesome 
1	bluetooth i click pictures in jpg format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth 
1	display the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary 
1	colors the use of colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone 
1	upgradibility it has great upgradibility 
1	log the log functions helps you track down the incoming outgoing calls in the most easy of ways 
1	handsfree the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving 
0	processor ear volume anyhow some demerits of this phone the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than but then the has the best ear volume among most nokia variants 
0	battery life the battery life of this phone is at most days and at least one day at excessive use 
0	video recording video recording is limited at just seconds 
0	upgrade you can upgrade but then theres a certain level of trouble involved 
1	phone this makes for a great phone 
0	phone ive had nokias for years and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use a phone 
0	phone on the plus side its packed with features including bluetooth that works fine its really a tiny computer that is also a phone and thats the negative 
0	screen as a computer or pda its weak since the screen while large by phone standards is still tiny to really do anything on 
0	dial when you dial a number youll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct 
0	keys youll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once 
0	screen i hope you have a magnifying glass because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny 
0	screen its as though nokia has segregated of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just for the day to day use 
0	phone ive have many nokias and while this is the best for features its the worst as a phone 
0	phone my old siemens s on the other hand worked beautifully with all of the above 
0	camera who in the hell needs a frigging vga camera on their cellphone 
1	phone since then i have not found one major problem with it 
1	camera pda i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and or lots of features you would find in a pda 
1	bluetooth transfer i own this phone for about months now i have used the following features bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook transfer files i have many movies on it now with a mb memory card that it takes 
1	handsfree handsfree future is good but not too exciting 
0	slow bluetooth only thing i dont like about it is slow in changing apps boot up and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth 
1	looking this one has a good looking 
1	look its oval and nice 
1	shape keypad joystick i like its shape and its keypad and joystick 
1	use small its easy to use not too small and not too big 
1	screen the screen is quite big but the just about color 
0	camera and other else the camera is still vga 
0	slow i must say this one is quite slow to open an application 
0	phone sometimes it needs few minutes to open an application 
1	phone few month ago its very popular among my community 
1	phone its good 
0	phone but not good enough for me 
1	color ok score oh yes the newest color of this phone is quite cool 
0	nokia i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones 
1	while this phone obviously doesnt have the same quality construction as motorola does the nokia is one of the better phones ive used 
1	versatility features what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has 
1	audio quality great audio quality overall 
1	audio quality handset quality is great as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality 
1	camera a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures movies and having general all around fun with 
1	joystick the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control 
0	joystick the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming 
1	ring tone game one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices 
1	nokia if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday nokia beats everyone else 
1	bluetooth bluetooth wireless technology so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables 
1	wide the phone is really wide which seems to be a turnoff for many people but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic 
1	small i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others which are actually starting to get too small 
0	construction my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices but they also dont last as long 
1	construction i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorolas do but as long as im not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine 
1	phone other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely wont disappoint any already established nokia phone fans 
0	interface operation its like bmws i drive it does its job but has the most unintuitive overly layered interface 
0	operation the phone must be shut down taken apart to change the memory card and turning the phone back on takes a little while 
0	instruction booklet even the instruction booklet is out of order 
1	applications applications it has lots of applications and they work very well when you eventually find where they are and they finally open 
0	applications no matter how accustomed to the phone you become too much time is required to get to open and close applications 
1	the has more ameneties than most world phone camera video speaker bluetooth infrared modem for computers electronic wallet internet access calendar calculator converter and more 
0	phone the phone does not have an mp player fm radio k color screen megapixel camera quad band pda photo editor 
1	dependability dependability ive seen no glitches 
1	phone ive had no problems w this phone 
0	keys styling ergonomics the keys are small which generally doesnt bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little braille but the keys run into each other so careful attn must be paid when dialing 
0	stylized its not as stylized as a sony or samsung 
1	big although it has chubby hips the device isnt really so big 
1	screen solid squeak free large screen 
1	memory memory storage seemingly boundless 
1	memory first of all the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos sound clips photos texts etc 
1	transmission secondly all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires 
1	mhz the is the true world phone in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe including new zealand and australia whereas the replaces it w mhz 
1	coverage the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries excluding new zealand and australia 
0	service the will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas 
1	as the uses mhz it operates in more countries than the 
1	battery life the battery life is less than stellar but it charges w the quickness 
1	operating system remember this phone uses an operating system symbian and its feature rich w k colors 
1	video it films second video for crying out loud 
0	battery life the battery life cant be very long lets not be greedy 
0	game dont use them so i delete them for addtl space 
1	downloads there are number of downloads needed available for this phone they will be texted to you at no cost 
1	phone a sony ericcson may be the phone for you but good luck finding one w all the features such a competitive price 
1	phone despite a critical start this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do does more than most does it well is dependable 
0	phone when you consider expandability the numerous features two transmission programs and multiple storage devices dependability this is a phone that isnt easy to out grow 
0	bluetooth bluetooth does not work on this phone 
0	bluetooth though nearly a dozen different people at both t mobile and nokia have told me otherwise it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices 
0	phone only then did i learn the truth this phone does not work with palm pdas 
0	nokia this simple nuance was too much for nokia and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free 
0	nokia in short nokia themselves dont know that this phone doesnt work with the palm and if you dont heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly 
0	nokia ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved 
0	photos the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too they look as though they were built out of legos 
1	phone this phone is one of the best ive ever used 
1	phone it has everything i needed bluetooth infrared support for mmc camera and a good operating system with lots of supporting software 
1	phone i would have given this phone stars if it wasnt for the fact that i would rather use my to do all the most common things you do with a phone 
0	interface its important that people know the following first the interface is slow 
0	interface you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu 
0	lag useable secondly in addition to the lag each time you give a command its just not that easily useable on the go 
0	number buttons fonts interface the number buttons are crammed into a x cm area the fonts are small the interface is too convoluted and frustrating its not that customisable as well 
1	look battery life memory the plusses are the features look good signal and battery life memory size and robustness 
1	camera video the camera and video functionality is decent i cant see myself wasting my time with it but some people will 
1	phone this is a great phone i have this phone since feb and i never have any problem at all 
1	features camera ringtones bluetooth very cool features great camera with zoom cool quality pictures great ringtones bluetooth feature is great 
0	phone this phone is not suitable for fast people maybe only for old people 
0	slow the menu pops up after seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory 
0	time the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy 
0	big at first glance i thought this phone was a little too big for me maybe a little too complicated 
1	phone this thing does everything but washes your dishes 
1	modem i can use it as a modem for my computer connect with clients and friends the possibilities are endless 
1	ringtones screen the ringtones are beautiful the screen is super high quality 
0	carrier i can not find a carrier for this phone i like end up just tossing it in my purse 
1	phone i do not need to repeat whats great about this phone 
0	phone card calling this phone doesnt include phone card calling 
0	phone card calling this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway 
0	feature my old sony ericsson t has this feature 
0	hear in noisy environment its hard to hear from the earpiece 
0	volume speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life 
0	phone unfortunately i sold it exactly a month later 
0	volume a cell phone is to make calls in other words quality of reception and mic speaker are the most important the has a relatively low volume speaker youd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying unless the surroundings were completely quiet 
0	bulky buttons it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use 
0	slow it is slow if you keep the original configuration and progs itll run smoothly but still slower than most other coloured screen nokias 
0	phone my idea was that it was an all in one and that theory once again proves wrong this phone excells at nothing less than average in everything if you seriously need any of the other than phone functionalities youll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but dont expect to get much done 
0	features basically the is a bundle of over hyped features you dont and wont need none of them work as they should and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average 
0	phone im an advocate of nokia but this phone and the following models are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone 
0	phones im giving it star because as compared to other nokia phones its a compared to other blunders by other companies it might be good but if youre getting a nokia dont get this one 
1	phone i never had a single problem 
1	menu it is nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options 
1	video pictures high quality video and pictures rock 
1	band band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider 
1	phone bottom line great phone for the time being 
1	color tft display camera video i use a nokia it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom which complement a built in video recorder with audio and a realone player for playback and streaming of gpp compatible and realmedia video clips 
1	multimedia functions multimedia functions are enhanced by multi slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone 
1	the nokia is a decent extension of the smartphone line 
1	keypad display rundown time software the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display long rundown time and a good software suite 
0	mmc slot design among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design 
1	in short the nokia is an evolution but not a revolution 
1	multimedia im sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email movie times news or any website with this phone 
1	picture you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call 
1	ringtone give each friend a different ringtone 
1	rings themes get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings 
1	screen a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it 
1	nokia phones nokia makes great phones and this one is the cream of the crop 
1	phone best phone ive ever owned period 
1	phone frankly i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware ive ever used 
1	speed it is slow to initially start up but once its turned on ive never had any complaints about the speed 
1	phone everything so far has worked flawlessly 
1	phone all at the same time and all without a hitch 
1	interface i think the interface is great 
1	i actually purchased two phones recently and this one is far superior 
1	features interface size camera internet connectivity quality i love the features the interface the size the camera the internet connectivity the quality etc 
1	phone if i had to do it over i wouldnt buy anything else 
1	signal upside this one like most nokias receives a consistently strong signal 
1	bluetooth i love the bluetooth easy to use with a wireless jabra headset 
1	photos photos are pretty darned good 
0	speed downside it takes a long time to start up 
0	speed my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use 
0	movies the movies last about seconds 
0	movies i mean theyre short 
0	feature i find this feature on this phone useless but since i dont really need this function anyway i dont really use it 
0	navigatee also when i dial an number like an airline it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu 
0	screen finally after about a weeks use the screen started to freeze on me 
0	calls it would not hang up on calls 
0	screen once it froze so bad i couldnt even use the power button to turn it off and had to open and take out the battery 
1	phone probably a great phone overall and perhaps mine just has bugs 
1	user interfaces bluetooth applications with one of the most intuitive user interfaces around seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on the nokia is all of the above one of the few phones from t mobile that can claim such a distinction 
1	phone ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned 
0	camera the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera 
1	phone this may be a really cool phone but its not worth it with t mobile 
0	service they have the worst service of any of the major companies 
0	t mobile i really regret signing up with t mobile but im stuck with them for the next months of the contract 
1	phone this phone is fantastic 
1	reception visibility interface great reception visibility and interface 
0	rebate just dont get drawn into t mobiles catchy rebate

1	phone i highly recommend this phone 
1	sony ericsson t i had a sony ericsson t before this and the t is far inferior 
1	battery life im able to keep my phone on for about a week to three days 
1	phone but this by far is the best phone out there right now 
1	screens i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens 
0	os the os is abit confusing at st but within a few days you will pass this learning curve 
1	pics the pics can be touched up in photoshop and be printed at x and they look great 
1	bluetooth i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple powerbook 
1	bluetooth the speed is the same as dail up where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up 
1	phone the phone itself is pretty nice 
1	camera quality camera quality isnt bad for the low resolution 
1	features this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard 
0	motorola t i calls syncing data i was using a motorola t i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data 
1	bluetooth battery life reception screen i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth had decent battery life could check email had good reception nice screen size and was durable 
1	interface the interface is simple to use 
0	menus menu load time i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over exaggerating the menu load time 
1	menu i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds no big deal 
1	menus i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker 
1	camera the camera is adequate and if i want high res photos ill use my digital camera instead 
1	t mobile service on the t mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i and email them to family friends once we reached a t mobile tzone 
1	t mobile service outside of the t mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at t wireless and various other services where the t mobile service was unavailable 
1	reception as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentuckys mountains 
1	battery life connectivity bars features along the way we compared it to my wifes t i and the was superior in terms of battery life connectivity bars and features 
1	isync for those mac osx users out there isync works fairly well 
0	bluetooth on occasion im not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem 
1	bluetooth battery and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would i usually can go days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge 
1	battery with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long 
1	phone the nokia is a great phone good games good camera 
0	video recorders the video recorders a bit odd sometimes i get secs on my recordings sometimes i get 
1	voice recorders the voice recorders good but you cant record songs off the radio for ring tones 
1	games the games are decent but u only get to start off with 
1	games but you can download some really good ones like pac man or mafia wars 
1	phones overall the phones fantastic and i would have given it stars but its not perfect 
1	battery the battery on mine lasts days if i dont play games that much and it only takes mins to charge from flat

1	call logs clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people 
1	bluetooth as for bluetooth no problems at all 
1	bluetooth ive connected the phone with two laptops and a ipaq 
1	bluetooth very simple and painless 
1	phone this is the first cell phone ive owned and overall i am quite pleased with it 
1	phone among my requirments for a phone were good screen decent camera bluetooth and gprs support 
1	phone the was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t mobile 
1	internet one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux where softmodem drivers are hard to find and dont work very well 
1	gprs if you are using linux and you want to use gprs to connect to the net i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter 
1	camera i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone 
1	feature and the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal pop smtp e mail account 
1	e mail i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward although you do need an external smtp server to use 
1	ringtone the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone 
1	ringtone music which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net 
1	bluetooth you can use the obex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux for sending files to the phone 
1	ringtones the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and or groups is really cool 
0	os i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues 
0	applications sometimes various applications crash 
0	bluetooth especially the bluetooth server meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again 
0	bluetooth this is somewhat annoying but from working with computers 
1	freespeak i really dislike holding a phone to my ear and ive found the freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone 
0	voice dialing system the only main drawback is the fact that the voice dialing system is kinda picky 
0	voice dialing system it takes a while to learn how to use it right and at this point i am able to make about of my calls using it 
0	voice dialing system however it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosnt work at all in the car for example 
0	size weight some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone and it has rightfully gotten the nick name the bar of soap which it really is 
1	size weight but if you use all bluetooth accessories as i do its really not an issue 
1	phone all in all this is a great phone 
1	price especially for the price amazon gives it at 
1	phone if you use linux and want grps and or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device and want a decent camera this is the phone for you 
1	phone i really love this phone 
1	t mobile you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour 
1	t mobile have had the nokia for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile 
1	features it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well 
1	signal i almost always get a good strong signal even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest 
1	sound speaker phone the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldnt be easier to use 
1	size shape i like the size and shape 
1	size shape it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket 
0	keys the only problem is the size of the keys 
0	key my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones 
0	kays they really are awfully small 
0	battery life also the battery life isnt great but its sufficient for my needs 
1	calls it also works just fine for international calls 
1	instant messaging its a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable 
1	quality its really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch 
1	t mobile ive had nothing but good luck with t mobile 
1	customer service agents service their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific 
1	calls i never get dropped calls 
1	t mobile i recommend t mobile and the nokia without reservation 
1	os the nokia runs the symbian os which works pretty well for most standard phone fare most of the stuff is not that intuitive but if you actually learn how to use it all theres plenty of neat tie ins 
1	phone use ive had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use

1	os other than that the simbian series os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if youre willing to hunt for it

0	buttons buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging 
0	buttons there will be much erasing of text as one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters 
0	video recorder video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the free picture and video messaging offered by service provider 
1	phone the bottom line is phone is cool one only for the moment as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones

1	phone i am just in love with this phone especially after using a more primitve phone about years 
0	software i have read the installation instructions for both nis and nav prior to installation but still ended up with the same result junk software 
0	norton products but if i installed either one of these norton products neither works after installation 
1	mcafee anti virus it can not be the computer or the owner since i purchased mcafee anti virus and it installs and works fine with no problems 
0	norton i have used norton for the past years and for the last years the software has gotten more and more disgraceful 
0	norton i am glad that i do not work for norton 
0	installation after attempted installs i have finally given up 
0	nis during install nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so 
0	manual shutdown the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the nd bar over and over 
0	norton i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer 
1	nis nis worked like a charm last year 
0	norton being a past norton customer i consider this to be a slap to my face 
0	installed buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non working computer 
0	norton norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products but with this one they have fallen off the cliff 
0	product as a loyal customer of norton symantec products i purchased internet security as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product 
0	program yeah this program protects your computer all right by locking you off the internet 
0	updates other than that it is all the same except the new updates 
1	symantec softwares but that is good for me because symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers 
0	scandisk so far i havent had so much complaints except that i still havent mastered how to scandisk when using internet security 
0	product too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time 
0	suite sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches 
1	speed im not sure why all the bad reviews my computer isnt especially slowed down and i have win 
1	speed sure it slows it down a little but thats expected 
1	semantic perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little but these reviews are highly exagerated i would ask what else these people are running on their computers 
0	nis norton internet security is one of the more buggy implementations 
0	installation this product has virtually all the same installation problems 
0	product for purposes of clarity here is my review from that product edited to be appropriate for this product since for the most part they share many of the same problems 
1	systemworks internet security this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite 
0	internet security this version of internet security is beyond hope 
0	install function they are a royal pain to install and dont function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all 
0	installation the biggest problem is the installation 
0	installed liveupdate system works internet security also if you do manage to get it installed any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and or the process of updating internet security 
0	product ive had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far and ive not to get either product working properly 
0	installation first it serious serious installation problems 
0	install back in may when i first reviewed this it had taken me over hours to install and run 
0	liveupdate almost from the beginning liveupdate would not function 
0	updates first it failed whenever connecting to get updates 
0	liveupdate when i finally got it working it only worked properly for many a month 
0	components the next problem was that it didnt recognize all the installed components so it would not update them most notably and importantly virus definitions 
1	functions once installed however some of the functions do work ok 
1	faster menu these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions and i found the menu to be much more navigable 
0	liveupdate but this doesnt make up for its innumerable other short comings the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate 
0	installs the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this 
0	removal program warning the windows remove program feature does not do a good job of this and neither does nortons own removal program 
0	fragments a lot of fragments were left in the registry and it the norton system folders 
1	remove their website had a download that helped remove those although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the programs directory 
0	install if you have an older version of internet security installed you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install 
0	remove you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry 
0	products as of october these products are not working and im ready to demand a refund from symantec 
0	functionality i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues 
0	reinstall once again it wont reinstall even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians 
0	version the best thing to do with this version is to leave it on the store shelf it doesnt work and will cost you an enormous amount of your time not to mention your hard earned dollars 
0	symantect products personally i may never buy symantect products again 
0	product avoid this product at all costs 
0	edition there are some highs to the edition but mostly lows 
0	program cost the program brings more problems than a virus albeit not as major problems just not what you expect for bucks 
0	support i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall and waited minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a customer priority id number 
0	priority id then when i went to nortons website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given i couldnt find a way to get one 
0	support so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question and got a reply which was totally unresponsive 
0	norton and when you think about it its insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops anyone who can provide proof of purchase whether on the phone or online should have equal priority 
1	memory usage nortons memory usage on systems with mb is very low 
1	memory usage i just got an older mhz system with pc ram and it also runs fine on that 
1	update both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together 
1	update you wont need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks 
1	visual backtracking the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking 
0	product stay away from this product 
0	i dont know whats happened to norton but is absolute garbage 
0	support the customer support is pathetic 
0	norton internet security i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience 
0	product this product is absolutely not ready for release 
0	slow it is buggy slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user 
0	product i am an it professional and have used norton for years but this product is a complete and utter dud 
0	internet security antivirus its a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus 
0	internet security antivirus software nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software 
0	parental controls even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer 
0	firewall now in october the firewall said i couldnt ok anymore software to use the internet because its full 
0	capacity support im at full capacity i called symantic and they said they dont know why but i should get techs support at hr to help i did call them and was on hold for minutes untill i hung up 
0	product upgrade so dont buy this or upgrade 
0	version if you currently own the version and are looking to upgrade to the version dont 
0	activation process product there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive 
0	product if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product save yourself some money and buy the version 
0	norton program from day one weve had hangups crashes glitches continual reboots long shutdowns due to ccapp exe program running which is a norton program 
0	norton long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot 
0	memory usage we constantly got windows virtual memory low error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and or crashes 
0	support norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer 
0	support norton support is completely pathetic 
0	home version do not buy any home version of norton anything 
1	corporate edition we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only and so far its great 
1	corporate edition ive used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever 
0	norton internet av our norton internet av was terrible right from the get go so id think that if sytemworks is ok now it should remain ok 
1	corporate by the way i use the norton corporate at work with absolutely no trouble 
1	professional version likewise ive heard norton professional version is fine too 
0	home version just the home version of norton internet av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with 
0	work i am an advanced computer user so i cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work 
0	program scan seems the program scan feature did not find the exe file for outlook 
0	support like most of their solutions the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not 
0	symantec it was a symantec error 
0	update after a recent update i can no longer open more then browser window 
0	support ive searched the program and their online tech support and have found no solutions 
0	products this is definitely one of those products especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit 
1	nis ive been using nis for about months and it works well 
1	intrusion norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from 
1	popup blocker anti spam the popup blocker and anti spam are bonuses 
1	nstalling i didnt have any major problems installing this software 
0	components the only problem i had was a few components didnt quite load correctly upon startup but a reboot fixed the problem 
1	working anyhow this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago 
0	installation i give it stars only because the installation process or rather problems that may surface during the installation process can be frustrating to the average computer user 
0	installation if you experience problems with installation you can visit symantecs website click the support tab click the home or home office support and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it 
0	installation cant get easier than that 
0	spam i already knew something was wrong because much of the spam ive seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products 
1	install mine installed no problem 
1	work seems to work great 
0	nis i read many reviews on norton i s from a variety of sources and came to the conclusion that nis was a terrible product and not worth the update 
0	booting booting up my computer took forever 
0	blocking then my ad pop up blocking was completely gone 
0	blocking my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites 
0	tech line again every review written about the tech line is true after waiting close to minutes i finally spoke to a rep 
0	tech after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program 
0	tech they didnt know what the problem could be 
0	support i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable 
0	tech basically i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help 
0	unstalling unfortunately it does not give you the option of unstalling them individually 
0	components you can disable some of the individual components but dont be fooled theyre still there and running 
0	norton antispam although i disabled norton antispam it is still there 
1	product this did manage to cut the number of popups during start up from down to 
0	popups but those come up every time 
0	norton charge next the big reason not to buy any norton product if theres a problem with it norton charges to even tell them about it 
0	charge norton sure they say if its their fault you wont get charged but they are the ones who get to decide whether its their fault 
1	nis while it didnt have all the features i would have liked it was better than anything else i could find at the time 
0	installing the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with 
0	install when i purchase software i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry 
1	spam killer also with one click you can help train your spam killer 
1	wizard and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan 
0	download i downloaded this set from norton and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download 
0	help their site offers no live help at all 
0	service support i tried to call norton and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non tech customer service or they have a tech support number 
0	cost who wants to pay to discuss a defect in a product that just cost 
0	support i finally got a free support number for norton through my isp support staff but waited an hour or more for a voice 
0	refund they said they would refund all the money but a month later they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping to handle and ship a cd and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails 
0	product support this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support 
0	support after years i now downloaded mccaffees product after calling their support they answered quickly and for free and were very helpful 
0	norton no problems now just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned thier customers 
0	norton i see many other reviews that say the same stay away from norton they dont deserve you or anyone 
1	firewall antivirus antispam parental control its a highly rated kick ass firewall program thats bundled with the venerable norton antivirus plus extras that make this security suite a must have for people who have broadband internet access 
0	version ive alway liked symantec products except for this version 
0	installing if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system 
1	product luckly with rebates this product will cost me nothing it is indeed worth nothing 
0	install uninstall to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted 
0	installation if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system or nortron antivirus the installation will go fine otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly 
0	support what dissapointes me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec if you want support theyll charge you a fee 
1	zone alarm sygate ive tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great 
0	symantec i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version 
1	help the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription 
0	firewall the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it 
0	symantec symantec should give us all a refund and apology 
0	product i will never buy their product again at this rate and neither should you 
1	product the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp 
1	antivirus no more banner ads pop ups and the reliable antivirus 
1	antivirus i work on word explorer netscape acrobat reader photoshop at same time but still dont see a problem with computer 
1	product this product is way cooler than anything ive used before 
1	product stars all the way 
1	product all in all it hasnt been a bad product 
0	symantec however symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release 
0	boot im currently using a sony vaio s and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system in fact ive taken to just hibernating rather than shutting down completely 
1	performance ive owned many norton products in my time and for the most part ive been pleased with their performance 
1	nis this is also the case with nis 
1	upgrade performance i upgraded from nis and the change in performance has not been noticeable 
1	upgrade on the contrary im quite pleased with my upgrade 
1	performance features it works better and has more useful features than nis 
1	program the program is fully featured with much of what youd want from a security program 
1	installation set up operation interfaces email spam the installation set up and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well 
0	symantec however i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec 
0	performance it feels like im back to the days of k dial up internet service even though im running a dell ghz pentium with mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year 
0	performance i tried disabling the various components provided with this product paring it all the way back to anti virus only service and saw no improvement 
0	symantec norton site there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec norton site 
0	product however i suspect that many people are having a bad experience do not purchase this product 
1	uninstall install piii ghz mb rdram windows xp pro gb hd i was able to uninstall nis and install nis with no trouble 
1	install i installed activated and registered nis without issue 
1	anti spam so far the anti spam feature seems to be very good 
0	program this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online 
0	product buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks 
0	processor i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed and then i couldnt get the damn thing off my computer completely 
0	install it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch 
1	computer associates ez i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ez firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again 
0	norton and i cant warn you enough to stay away from norton 
1	installation i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here 
0	speed it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer 
0	size scanning i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open close scanning that it does with every program 
0	scan is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program 
0	firewall i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory but this firewall just brought it to a halt 
0	slow start up log off log on everything became very slow 
0	home network configuring it for a home network was almost impossible 
0	network multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like youd expect 
0	alerts while i was trying to play half life it started popping up with alerts every twenty seconds warning me my antivirus protection was off 
0	alerts but it wouldnt let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldnt stop with the alerts 
0	uninstall i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago and it wouldnt let me do that either 
0	uninstall i tried it again this morning and it said i didnt have the required permissions and lacked proper administrator status 
0	symantec customer service of course if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay per incident 
0	uninstallation this time it started the uninstallation process then i left for work i think it will work i hope it will work 
0	symantec i simply hate symantec i swear if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare bleeding hands i would have 
1	products their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions 
1	router this router does everything that it is supposed to do so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it 
1	setup installation it was a very quick setup and installation in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up 
1	install by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do 
1	works it works great i am usually at the full mbps although every now and then that drops to around mbps only because i am floors below where the router is 
1	router it really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house 
1	router there are computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router and everybody is happy with it 
1	setup router its the easiest thing to setup i thought and i am only so with all that said buy the router 
0	wizard the wizard is particularly sinister 
0	wizard it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre existing router without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard wired pc or a wireless equipped pc 
0	setup the box proudly displays secureeasysetup wireless made simple one touch setup button easy start easy security easy everyday apparently linksys cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial 
1	router i recently bought the linksys wrt g router and have been very happy with the router itself 
0	configuration however configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than hours and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup 
0	cd too bad they dont mention anything about how the cd cant be used with a mac 
0	user manual i even downloaded the products user manual useless 
0	technical support the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac 
0	instruction i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so 
0	documentation what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems 
0	setup im giving it stars because the setup process was so miserable 
1	product but the product iself is great 
1	router once you set it up its great 
1	well priced and it is extremely well priced for what youre getting 
1	performance another star performance 
1	cd this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time 
1	speed pertaining to the speed issue i got mps while i was in the same room 
1	works this router works at mbps thats megabyte not kilobyte 
1	running i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of plus kilobytes on the download e 
1	broadband broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies 
1	installation installation was as near automatic as can be 
1	equipment all in all this is a star piece of equipment 
0	wep encryption i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa 
1	connectivity even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity 
1	firmware update new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration 
1	configuration all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network 
1	router awesome for the newbie though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself 
1	installation comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router 
1	setting up you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network 
0	costlier linksys is more costlier than others and is a home consumer division of cisco 
0	instructions there were no other obvious setup instructions though there was a softcopy manual it did not give an answer readily on what do to 
0	security the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection 
1	works the router works fine for both wired and wireless 
1	connect i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly 
1	connect overall if you know what basic steps to take it was not difficult to connect and the s w worked well to connect 
0	cd little to no networking experience just in case the automatic cd method has issues 
1	router id give it stars if possible but since stars would be misleading i give it stars 
0	enterprise piece this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment 
1	router i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it 
0	hardware version the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half 
1	wrt g just want a wireless router for home or your very small business you can just get a wrt g from here and configure it 
1	wrt g i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router just get the wrt g 
0	cd i tried the cd setup program without any luck 
1	yes the number probably redirected me to someone in india but the guy was easy to understand and he helped solve the problem 
0	cd essentially the cd included with the package is for the most part worthless 
1	product itll make life a lot easier and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review 
1	router this is my fourth linksys product and aside from the rough start im very satisfied with this router 
1	router this linksys router does it for the right price 
1	range the range is terrific i am using this for my home and i was transferring at mbs from my backyard 
1	wrt g ive since gotten the linksys modem and stacked it with the wrt g router and it works fantastic 
1	set up it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasnt called me yet with any problems 
1	instructions there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging stealing your bandwidth 
1	installation and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lik my aunt to follow 
1	product a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years 
1	security speed i upgraded from an older b router to the linksys wrt g for its improved security and of course speed 
0	router however this product performed well below my expectation 
0	stream copy large files the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music or copy large files over the local network 
0	design after some research on the net i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt g design 
1	security as i mentioned in my first paragraph it supports wpa security which is far superior to wep 
1	setup in addition it is very easy to setup

1	documentation the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the b router i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up 
1	router signal strength i like this router a whole lot better the linksys b router it replaced the signal strength seems ot be much stroners seldom falling below the very good range and most often excellent within feet of the router

1	router there seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router

0	firmware the firmware has bugs too so download and install the latest firmware from linksys 
0	instant setup the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually

1	cd second the setup cd actually worked perfectly 
1	installation i still need to read up on some of the security settings etc to fully understand all thats up there but bottom line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speedboost router 
0	manual even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with mac settings etc 
1	antenna when i saw a high gain antenna was available to the wrt g router i thought id happily give up some speed in favour of wider coverage 
0	important to note that what i really needed was an access point as my dsl modem already does the router thing and i have a wired m network round the house setup setting up the system was not too complicated 
1	signal having done all this i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal 
1	speed the box is upstairs and in the farthest room i get connected at m speed that is similar to the older m ethernet standard 
1	signal apart from speed the signal is consistent and works without interruptions etc 
1	coverage the wrt g plus the hga t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard walled house as was my case 
0	router we bought this about months ago and its been worthless 
0	connection slow it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow 
0	support the tech support is worthless too
